# Galid

GaLiD is yet another tool to edit EmulationStation's gamelist.xml files.

(https://github.com/Aloshi/EmulationStation/blob/master/GAMELISTS.md)

TODO: Write something here...

## Todos

- Checking rom file existence (highlight missing red maybe)
- Saving files
- Images (image, thumb, icon)
- Folders (at least in read-only mode) (uncollapsed-all fake treeview)
- Create folders
- Delete, clone and move games and folders
- Genre selection (will need to get a list of those)
- File list scanning to generate an empty gamelist (will need to get filenames for each platform, yuk)
- Bulk editing multiple games
- Tree list memoization (WeakMap sounds good? Should these be mutable maybe?)
- Drag-n-drop images (https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/issues/87#issuecomment-915054980)

## Todos - long plans

- Search for developers etc
- Some scraping. Most websites are greedy - so will need kind of an API.
